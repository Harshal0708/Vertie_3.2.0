    <string name="biofeedback_introduction_1">Biofeedback is a mind-body technique enabling you to learn about your physiological responses and how to change them to improve your health, well-being, and performance. By monitoring your vital signs, you can gain control over physiological processes that are usually considered unconscious or automatic.</string>
    <string name="biofeedback_introduction_10">Breathing out through pursed lips will reduce the effort that exhalation takes and gives you more control over your breathing pace.</string>
    <string name="biofeedback_introduction_2">With our biofeedback exercise, we will help you to enhance the connection between your heart and brain. HRV-Biofeedback has been shown to have beneficial effects on several health issues ranging from chronic pain to anxiety and depression.</string>
    <string name="biofeedback_introduction_3">To have a good understanding of how to breathe right, try the following exercise without the smartphone:</string>
    <string name="biofeedback_introduction_4">Sit in an upright position, relax your shoulders, shifting them downward away from the ears.</string>
    <string name="biofeedback_introduction_5">Put the left hand on your chest and the right hand on your stomach.</string>
    <string name="biofeedback_introduction_6">Without straining or pushing, breathe in through your nose and feel the air moving through your nostrils. Exhale slowly through pursed lips (as if you were whistling). With your right hand feel your belly getting bigger during the inhalation phase, and smaller during the exhalation phase.The left hand on the chest should not move.</string>
    <string name="biofeedback_introduction_7">The position you adopt for sitting (upright, with relaxed shoulders) will help you to relax some of your upper body muscles and better regulate your respiration performance</string>
    <string name="biofeedback_introduction_8">Placing your hands on your chest and abdomen will enhance your perception of how your body changes during abdominal breathing and will help you reproduce these changes in the long term. Abdominal breathing is the most efficient way to breathe, maximizing the expansion ability of the lungs.</string>
    <string name="biofeedback_introduction_9">Breathing in through your nose will filter, humidify and warm up the inhaled air. Some research indicates that this type of breathing activates brain centers responsible for sensory experiences.</string>

Try to become more aware of the effect your mood has on your body to have more control over your responses to daily challenges.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_affect_mood_good">Currently, you are in a good mood. Your mood can have a big impact on your emotional but also on your physical state.

Try to become more aware of the effect your mood has on your body to have more control over your responses to daily challenges.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_affect_mood_okay">Currently, you are feeling okay. Your mood can have a big impact on your emotional but also on your physical state. Try to become more aware of the effect your mood has on your body to have more control over your responses to daily challenges.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_affect_pulse">\n        â€¢ Activity: When you exercise, your pulse naturally rises. While resting, sitting or standing, your heart rate usually does not change. However, it may increase slightly during the first 15 seconds of standing and then settle back down.\n\n        â€¢ Emotions: If you feel stressed, anxious, or euphoric, your pulse may increase. Whereas, if you feel tired, the pulse decreases.\n\n        â€¢ Medications: Medications that inhibit your adrenaline, called beta blockers, usually slow down your pulse, whereas, some thyroid medications may increase it.\n\n        â€¢ Body size: Obesity can cause an increase in the resting pulse (usually no more than 100 beats per minute).\n\n        â€¢Temperature: When the air temperature and humidity are high, your heart pumps more blood, which can cause a slight increase in pulse rate (between 5 and 10 beats per minute).\n    </string>
    <string name="result_dialog_affect_recovery_excellent">You currently have excellent energy reserves and are well prepared to recover from present and future challenges. You can easily relax and recharge your batteries.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_affect_recovery_good">You currently have enough energy reserves and are well prepared to recover from present and future challenges. Nevertheless, make sure that you do not overstrain your body and occasionally allow yourself some time off.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_affect_recovery_okay">Your body is slowly running out of energy reserves. Therefore, it will be difficult for you to recover from present and future stress and strains. Take some time and allow yourself a break to rebuild your reserves.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_affect_recovery_poor">At the moment, you have hardly any energy reserves left. Therefore, it will be extremely difficult for you to recover from present and future challenges. It is crucial that you take time to recharge your batteries.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_affect_stress_high">You have a high tension index, which is a hallmark of cardiovascular system stress. We are all exposed to a variety of stress factors on a daily basis. But our individual response to stress can be crucial for our health. Try to observe how you are feeling and acknowledge what is stressing you. Take a minute to reflect and process this information, so that you can pay better attention to your body and your needs in the future.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_affect_stress_low">You have a low tension index. This indicates that your cardiovascular system works efficiently, with few resources being invested in current activities. However, this may still lead to an overly relaxed state that makes you feel lethargic. Our bodies need a certain amount of tension in order to be alert and function at their best. Try to stand up and move a little, take deep breaths or simply do a few quick stretches to activate your body.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_affect_stress_medium">You have a medium tension index, which indicates that your body is in a balanced state. It is alert and full of energy. This state is optimal because a slight healthy tension helps us to be attentive and agile and makes the body function at its best.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_affect_stress_very_high">You have a very high tension index, which is a hallmark of high cardiovascular system stress. Possible causes are physical strain, pressure to perform, interpersonal problems or other stressful situations, unhealthy habits, or pharmacological treatment. It is crucial that you take time to consider the factors that are affecting your current state. This will help you to prevent stress in the future and improve the quality of your life in the long run.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_meaning">What does this mean?</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_meaning_pulse_high">Your pulse is relatively high. If you have taken medication, exercised or felt very stressed right before the measurement, these may be the reasons for your elevated pulse. Otherwise, a high pulse indicates that at the moment, your cardiovascular system is not working efficiently. Sometimes, it can reflect a prolonged or chronic stress state. You may want to discuss the causes of your elevated heart rate with your doctor.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_meaning_pulse_low">Your heart rate is relatively low. As long as you have not taken any medication before the measurement and are not tired, this indicates that your cardiovascular system is working very efficiently. Relatively few heartbeats are needed to supply blood to your organs.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_meaning_pulse_normal">Your heart rate looks normal. It takes an average number of heartbeats to supply your organs with blood.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_meaning_recovery">This index reflects your available energy reserves. Your body needs these reserves to recover from challenges and to quickly adjust to subtle changes in the environment. The higher the value, the faster you will be able to recover from stress.</string>
    <string name="result_dialog_meaning_stress">This result is a measure of the tension in your cardiovascular system. The lower the value, the more relaxed you are. The higher the value, the more tense you are.</string>
